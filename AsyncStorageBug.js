In React Native, when using AsyncStorage to store and retrieve data, a common error is encountering a TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'AsyncStorage.setItem') or similar errors related to AsyncStorage being undefined. This usually happens because the AsyncStorage library isn't properly linked or imported.  Another less common error involves improper handling of asynchronous operations within AsyncStorage. Forgetting to handle the Promise returned by AsyncStorage methods (setItem, getItem, etc.) leads to unpredictable behavior and potential crashes.
